## IC Cards (Suica / Pasmo)
Most convenient way to pay for trains, buses, and convenience stores. *Note: Sale of physical Suica cards is currently restricted due to chip shortage.*

## Trains
- **JR Lines**: Key for getting around Tokyo (Yamanote Line).
- **Subway**: Tokyo Metro and Toei Subway.

## Taxi
Taxis are clean but expensive. Doors open automatically.
